Firmware For Emulators

This is the rough working list. It's not fully checked and should not be
relied upon, particularly for licensing and redistributability.

rc2014 (z80):
	Small setups: https://rc2014.co.uk/1716/basic-cp-m-romwbw-or-small-computer-monitor/
		- Non-free, dubious copyright on BASIC
	512/512K - RomWBW (https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW)
		- Redistributable, mostly open source (some bundled non
		  free historic components)

	Some other variants have different requirements or a built in tiny
	booter.
